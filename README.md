# AI_study
Academic project to study different machine learning models and optimization techniques

This project aims to compare different models and find a lightweight and efficient model to embed in a system. 

Lightweight means that the model should have a small number of parameters. 
Efficient means that it must achieve an accuracy of at least 90%.

A score will be calculated for the best model we find.
We have chosen to train our models on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
